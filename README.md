# Password Generator Site

## Overview of project
The project given was to create a javascript password generator, with a HTML and CSS file provided.
The generator was to give the user the option to omit character types from their password, and allow the user to have any combination of symbols, numbers, lowercase letters and uppercase letters. The generated password was then to be displayed on the webpage.
